# employee-payroll-refactor

The purpose of this challenge was to add employees into a table by creating a prompt where you could add first name, last name and salary. Then, there would be code that in the console log would display the average salary as well as a random employee from the list the user made. 

The challenge had the following acceptance criteria:
GIVEN an employee payroll tracker
WHEN I click the "Add employee" button
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts asking for first name, last name, and salary
WHEN I finish adding an employee
THEN I am prompted to continue or cancel
WHEN I choose to continue
THEN I am prompted to add a new employee
WHEN I choose to cancel
THEN my employee data is displayed on the page sorted alphabetically by last name, and the console shows computed and aggregated data
